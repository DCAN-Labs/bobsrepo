## Downloading BOBs Repository Data from Amazon S3 Bucket

We recommend using [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) to download the BOBs Repository image files locally. After downloading and opening Cyberduck, do the following to connect to the data repository bucket stored on Amazon Web Services S3 bucket:

1. Click *Open Connection*
2. In the dropdown menu at the top of the dialogue box, select *Amazon S3* and the Server box will automatically populate with *s3.amazonaws.com*
4. Check *Anonymous Login* (if you are unable to check this box, type "anonymous" into the Access Key ID field instead) 
5. Expand the More Options tab and enter for Path: `future/path/to/data`
6. Click *Connect*
